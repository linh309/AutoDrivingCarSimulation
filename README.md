# AutoDrivingCarSimulation
- My application is organized into 4 main objects:
- Car: Contains all information of the car and is in charge of making the car move and change to the right position and direction.
- Map: Contains the axis and the list of coordinates. It tracks the movement of the cars and manages the collision.-
- Coordinate: It presents a position on the map with X-axis, Y-axis, and the occupied car.
- Simulator: It acts as the entry point of the application, helping initialize and start the simulation.
