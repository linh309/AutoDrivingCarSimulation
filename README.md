# AutoDrivingCarSimulation
 - My application is organized to 4 main objects:
 -- Car: Contains all information of the car and in charge of making the car move and change to the right position and direction.
 -- Map: Contains the axis and the list of coordinates. It tracks the movement of the cars and manage the collision.
 -- Coordinate: It presents a position in the map with X-Axis, Y-Axis and the occupied car.
 -- Simulator: It acts like the entry point of the application, helping initialize and start the simulation.
